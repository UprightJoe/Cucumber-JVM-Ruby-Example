THIS BRANCH REQUIRES THE GEM STUFF TO BE IN CUCUMBER-JVM JRUBY STUFF.

IT WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT IT OMG

To install the gems into the local filesystem (I haven't committed the gems)

    mvn test -Pinstall-gems

The gems will be installed into ${builddir}/src/test/gems the same path as specified in the 
cucumber-jruby.properties file.

Then your tests will pass! HORJAY!
